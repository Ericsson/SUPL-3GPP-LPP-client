 * @brief Computes the Shapiro delay for a given satellite and ground position.
 *
 * This function calculates the relativistic path range effect, also known as the Shapiro signal
 * propagation delay, which is the time delay experienced by a signal as it travels through the
 * curved spacetime caused by the Earth's gravitational field.
 *
 * @param satellite The satellite's state, including its true position and range.
 * @param ground_position The ground position in a 3D coordinate system.
 * @return Shapiro The computed Shapiro delay and a boolean indicating success.
 *
 * The calculation is based on the formula provided by the ESA's Navipedia:
