# Interface
This folder contains the code for the interface library. The interface library is a abstraction layer between the interface and the application. E.g., you use a TCP connection to communicate with the receiver. These are the following supported interfaces:
- Serial
- I2C
- File (one-way communication)
- TCP
- UDP
- Stdout (one-way communication)
